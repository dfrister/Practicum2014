Prototype_rev1:
Direct control of 3 LEDs from 1 sensor input. No mux.

Prototype_rev2:
Control of 3 LEDs from 1 sensor input. Added multiplexer.

Prototype_rev3:
Control of 6 LEDs from 2 sesnor inputs through multiplexer.

Prototype_rev4:
Added support for a third sensor. Arbitrarily assigned 4 bit outputs to mux.
Added method to detect a change in states.

Prototype_rev5:
Added code to support enabling/disabling the mux. This corresponds to revision changes in the board layouts.

testMux:
This code will light up each light individually on the display board. This is used to test board functionality.

FinalCode_rev2:
This version of the code is experimental and has provisions for timeouts.
